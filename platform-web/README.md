## Q & A

### 1. How to mock ?

The 'mock' at here means the request send by the model to the backend and return the simulated data. After 'npm start', mock will be enable by default, just refer to the official examples in the '/mock' folder to learn more. In other words, as long as the interface path in the mock is consistent with that in the backend, the mock method will be taken first, if there is no interface in the mock, then the backend interface will be requested.

## TODO

1. Try to overpass the login function at the front-end by mocking data. --rich
